BY USING THIS CLIENT YOU CAN SYNCHRONIZE YOUR CAPS LOCK STATE WITH EVERYONE ELSE USING THIS CLIENT

WHENEVER I PRESS CAPSLOCK IT IS PRESSED FOR YOU AND VICE-VERSA

NO MORE DISAGREEING ABOUT WHEN TO USE CAPS LOCK

NOW WE CAN ALL SHARE A SINGLE KEY!

## QUESTIONS

### WHY DO THIS
I WANTED US TO ALL AGREE ABOUT CAPS LOCK USAGE

### WILL THIS BREAK MY COMPUTER
IDK JUST MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO STOP A PROCESS BEFORE RUNNING IT

### HOW WELL TESTED IS THIS
NO TESTS I WROTE MOST OF IT OVER THE WEEKEND BUT I TESTED IT ON EACH PLATFORM A FEW TIMES

### WHAT PLATFORMS ARE SUPPORTED
MAC, WINDOWS, AND LINUX. BUT LINUX REQUIRES THAT YOU INSTALL `xdotool` SO MAKE SURE TO DO THAT

### HOW TO INSTALL??

DOWNLOAD CODE. THEN

EITHER:
* USE [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) WHICH MIGHT HANDLE EVERYTHING FOR YOU
* `uv client.py` OR SOMETHING IDK IF YOU USE UV YOU KNOW THIS

OR

* CREATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
* ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python client.py`

### SHOULD I DO THIS

IF YOU ARE ASKING THAT QUESTION THEN PROBABLY NOT
